# Shiny Project on Google Merchandise Store


Google Analytics Team has shared an open dataset on Google Merchandise Store through BigQuery. The variables in the data is what you can find in a typical ecommerce website. Basd on the data, I created a scenario where Google Merchandise Store team wants to expand its online store in terms of transaction number and revenue through brand merchandising.

In the project folder, you can find the following:

- Python Jupitor notebook on querying data. Because R cant communicate with BigQuery, I had to use the python kernel to query the data. Most of the data can be found inside the folder. Due to github's size limit, some dataset are not included. 
- Inisde google_store folder, you can find my r codes (server.R, us.R, global.R, and project.R). project.R has all the data importing, data cleaning, and data visualization. 
- Inside google_store/www, you can find my index.html file, css and js files under css folder and js folder. The skeleton of the html file was desgined by Glint. I mostly modified to make it work with R Shiny. 
- Data from 2016.08.01 to 2017.07.31 is only available at the moment.


## Problem Statement ##

## Variables ##

**Some important variables that were used in this project::**

- bounce_rate: Bounce rate is single-page sessions divided by all sessions, or the percentage of all sessions on your site in which users viewed only a single page and triggered only a single request to the Analytics server. If the success of your site depends on users viewing more than one page, then, yes, a high bounce rate is bad. For example, if your home page is the gateway to the rest of your site (e.g., news articles, product pages, your checkout process) and a high percentage of users are viewing only your home page, then you donâ€™t want a high bounce rate.

- hit: An interaction that results in data being sent to Analytics

- pageviews: Page views

- timeOnSite: time in seconds user spent on website

- pagePath: Page path

- channelGrouping: [link to Explanation on channelGrouping!](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6010097?hl=en)

- newVisits: Whether user is a new customer or a returning customer

- revenue: Originally from totalTransactionRevenue. revenue = totalTransactionRevenue/1000000

- socialEngagementType: Whether user socially engaged with the website or not by following a social media platform or not.
